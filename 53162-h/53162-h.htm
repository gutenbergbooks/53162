<h2><a name="Introduction" id="Introduction">Introduction</a></h2>


<p>In giving these few poems of Roger Casement to the
Irish people I do not claim for them any special value
as Irish literature. Roger Casement was not a poet, he
would have been the last to lay claim to any such title,
but, like the greater part of his fellow-countrymen, he
felt from time to time the impulse to express some
particular thought in verse, and he used to jot down,
sometimes in a letter to a friend, sometimes on an odd
half sheet of paper, the thought clothed in a poetic form
just as it came into his mind.</p>

<p>His was a nature of peculiar delicacy and refinement
and of singular simplicity; he had but one passion,
Ireland, but one deep sympathy&mdash;compassion for the
helpless and oppressed.</p>

<p>Even as a little boy he turned with horror and revulsion
from cruelty of every description: he would
tenderly nurse a wounded bird to life, and stop to pity
an overloaded horse. This gentleness and tender-heartedness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>
was one of his most marked characteristics;
it led him to champion the cause of the Congo native
and the Putumayo Indian, and to spend his slender
means in later life in trying to relieve the wretched
fever-stricken inhabitants in Connemara when typhus
was raging among them, or to provide a mid-day meal
for children in the Gaeltacht, who after walking perhaps
for miles to school, through storm and rain, would have
gone hungry all day if his kindly heart had not pitied
them. When he was stricken with misfortune, it was
these same children whose touching letters to him and
whose words of consolation, with their prayers, brought
tears to his eyes.</p>

<p>The act which brought him to his death was the result
of long years of brooding over Ireland and her destiny;
it was not a sudden and new impulse as some have
endeavoured to prove. To say that his interest in Ireland
began with his retirement from the service of the
British Foreign Office is to misrepresent the facts
entirely. Roger Casement from his earliest days was
before everything else a lover of Ireland. In his school<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span>
days he begged from the aunt, with whom he spent his
holidays, for possession of an attic room which he turned
into a little study, and the writer remembers the walls
papered with cartoons cut out of the <i>Weekly Freeman</i>,
showing the various Irish Nationalists who had suffered
imprisonment at English hands for the sake of their
belief in Ireland a Nation. Many years later, when he
himself was a prisoner in an English gaol he wrote:
"I have felt this destiny on me since I was a little boy;
it was inevitable; everything in my life has led up to
it." He seemed in a curious way to have a foreboding
of his fate. Once, years before his retirement, he was
joking with a friend about some wonderful plan that
was conceived in a mood of playfulness, and the carrying
out of which would have involved considerable danger.
The friend pointed out that the disadvantage of it all
lay in the fact that they might accidentally kill someone,
and "then," she added, "we'd be hanged." Roger
Casement was silent for a moment, his deepset eyes fixed
on an invisible goal, and then he said very quietly, "I
think I shall be hanged for Ireland." A friend tells me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span>
that later he made a similar observation to a man who
spoke of old rebellions and the fate of their leaders,
"I shall be hanged, too, for leading an attack on Dublin
Castle."</p>

<p>An incident is told of his life in South Africa, about
the time of the Boer War. He was one day, with two
companions on the verandah of a hotel, when a lady
who had been observing them from a distance for some
time approached them. She excused herself for addressing
strangers and explained that she had felt compelled
to do so as they had interested her profoundly. Explaining
that she had the gift of second-sight, she asked
permission to tell their fortunes, to which they consented,
looking upon the matter as a joke. Having told
the fortunes of the lady and of the second companion,
she turned at last to Roger Casement, and stated that
his was the most interesting fate. She described his
adventurous life in broad outline, and then said, "You
must take care: at the age of 52 you will come to a
violent end." Roger Casement was within a month of
his fifty-second birthday when he died.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a curious remoteness about him at times.
He used to sit for long periods silent in a reverie, and
would awaken from it with a sudden start. In his
habits he was always simple and frugal; he rose very
early in the morning and was always at work before
breakfast; he cared nothing for society in the worldly
sense, but he loved his friends and was always and invariably
happy in the company of children of all ages
and classes. Once the writer was walking with him
through the streets of an old country town when a tired
woman after a shopping expedition was vainly urging
an equally tired, and, I am bound to say, naughty little
boy to "come on." When at last in exasperation she
called out, "Very well, I'll go home without you," the
culprit set up an ear-piercing yell and flung himself
down on the ground. Roger turned round at once, to
hasten back. "Ah! poor soul," he said, "his heart is
broken, God help him; I'll pick him up."</p>

<p>Small children always adored him. The tiny three-year-old
child of a charwoman working in the house
where he was staying used to creep in from the kitchen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span>
and try to catch his eye as he sat writing. He always
had a smile and caress for her, and one day her mother
found her trying with both hands to turn the handle of
the study door and scolded her. She hung her head
and said, "I wanted to see the gentleman with the kind
eyes."</p>

<p>Many a little beggar child in Dublin knew the smile
in those kind eyes, and they used to greet him with
smiles in return and always get their copper or two.
We used to tease him, and say he walked through the
streets of Dublin "buying smiles at a penny each." I
do not think any Irish man, woman, or child ever
appealed to him for sympathy and help that he did not
give.</p>

<p>On a motor tour through Donegal with some friends he
met an old woman whose son and his wife had died and
left to her care a family of small children. They looked
poor and hungry, and the old woman found it hard to
make her little farm support them all. "Wouldn't
they be better for some milk?" asked Roger, seeing
them make a scanty meal, with water to drink. "Indeed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</a></span>
they would if I could be getting it for them," said the
grandmother. Roger made no answer, but at the next
market town he bought a cow and had it sent out to
the old lady.</p>

<p>It was in Ireland he always felt at home; he hated
big cities, noise, music-halls, and restaurants. He wrote
from London on one visit, "I feel more and more of
a foreigner here"; but in the Irish country, with the
simple country folk, he was always content. One of
the happiest experiences of his life in later years was
a short visit he paid to Tory Island in 1912, when he
organised a Ceilidh, to which everyone on the island was
invited. He sat in the crowded schoolroom, watching
the boys and girls dancing their reels and jigs, and
listening to the Gaelic songs till far on into the night,
when the Ceilidh broke up. He loved the Tory
people and used to plan many times to go back and visit
them. Tory has a sort of fascination about it, it looks
so remote and unreal, "like an opal jewel in a pale blue
sea," he described it once in a letter.</p>

<p>During all the time of his varied experiences abroad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</a></span>
in Africa and South America, his mind turned always
with longing and affection to Ireland. He looked upon
himself as an Irishman before all things. He eagerly
watched for the rare arrival of mails bringing word of
Ireland and her doings. "Send me news of Ireland,"
he wrote from South America, "and also what the
papers say about the Congo, but chiefly Ireland; Ireland
first, last, and for ever."</p>

<p>Although not a rich man (he had no private means)
he contributed generously to all Irish schemes for furthering
the National life. He helped several of the
Gaelic Colleges, gave prizes in schools for the study of
Irish, and did his best to help along many of those
newspapers and periodicals which were founded by
young and hopeful Irishmen to expound their views
and which alas! so often came to an untimely end.</p>

<p>With his singularly generous nature money mattered
nothing at all to him save for the use he could make of
it to help the work he had at heart. He spent little
upon himself, in fact he denied himself all luxuries, and
even comforts, that he might have to give to Irish causes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[Pg xvii]</a></span>
or to the Irish poor. Those who said of him that he sold
himself for money knew nothing of the man they were
slandering. He was wholly indifferent to money for its
own sake. His scrupulous integrity as to public funds
was illustrated by the following:&mdash;When he was called
to give evidence before a certain commission, as he was
waiting his turn with others who had to travel to London
for the same purpose, one of the secretaries remarked to
a witness, "Do you see that man?" (pointing to Roger
Casement), "Well, all the rest have charged first-class
railway fares, but he has put down third."</p>

<p>He wrote much on the Irish question. Letters from
his pen appeared in many Irish newspapers, and not a
few English ones, and his essays, which will, it is hoped,
be published later, show not only a deep insight but
much literary skill. His speech from the dock was
described by a leading English literary man as an effort
"worthy of the finest examples of antiquity."</p>

<p>At the age of 52 he came to a violent end....
So have many others who died for Ireland; he stands
among his peers, the Irish martyrs. He would not have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[Pg xviii]</a></span>
chosen to die otherwise, the love of his life was Kathleen
ni Houlihan; when he thought he heard her voice calling
from her four green fields he had no choice but to obey,
though he knew it led to death; but death which comes
in such a form to the body leaves the spirit but freer to
carry on its purpose.</p>

<p>The men of 1916 are not dead in any real sense, for</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
